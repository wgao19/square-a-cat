## More stories

Square a Cat's creator, Wei, has a climbing partner who likes to take photos of others when climbing.
One day during their regular bus rides from KL back to SG, the OCD friend scratches his head and asked if he could "add a border" to photos.
After some questions to understand what the "border" was referring to, Wei realized that her climbing partner wants his photos in squares so they can make Instagram happy.

Wei has been a web front end engineer for years and believes that there must be an app specifically for this purpose.
After a few rounds of searches, the apps she found either ask for $$$ or are spammed with lots of ads.
They're not cool.
So she decided to build one herself.
